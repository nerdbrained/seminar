Almost 200 years after Évariste Galois's death, there is still one question
about Galois groups — the symmetries of the roots of polynomials, that still
remains unsolved. This is the Inverse Galois Problem — whether every group is a
Galois group of a Galois extension of the rational numbers. In this talk, I
will give an overview of the progress that has been made, the approaches that
mathematicians are making, and directions for further research.

Required knowledge about Galois theory will be given at 17:00, prior to the
beginning of the talk at 17:30.
