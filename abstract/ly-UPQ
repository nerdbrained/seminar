In this talk, we generalize universal property of quotients (UPQ) into
arbitrary categories. UPQs in algebra and topology and an introduction to
categories will be given before the abstraction. As in the discovery of any
universal properties, the existence of quotients in the category of sets and
that of groups will be presented.
