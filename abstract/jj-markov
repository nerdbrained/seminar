The talk will introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo methods as a means of sampling from a
distribution. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm will be discussed as well as applications of
Markov chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian inference and optimization.

Will expect familiarity with basic probability theory, especially conditional probability.
