The talk was given by Fengyang Wang.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>Constructive mathematics, as the name would suggest, is centered on the philosophy that mathematical proofs should be able to be turned into algorithms. We will contextualize constructive approaches to analysis, roughly following Bridges and V√Æ≈£ƒÉ. This talk has no formal prerequisites beyond an elementary understanding of the real numbers and the usual concept of completeness. In particular, no logical background is assumed; intuitionistic logic will be overviewed in the talk. We will finish with a discussion of the ramifications of completeness of the real numbers.</p></div><h2>Summary</h2><div><h2>Introduction to Constructive Mathematics</h2><blockquote><p>It was proven by Cantor that a good math joke exists. Unfortunately, his proof was entirely non-constructive.</p></blockquote><p>Attribution: <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/2960">Jon</a></p><blockquote><p>My homework does exist, but no one can find it.</p></blockquote><p>Attribution: Printed in The Times of London, February 3, 2004. Obtained from Bridges and V√Æ≈£ƒÉ.</p><p>Constructive mathematics is mathematics that avoids obscuring the underlying algorithms and their computational information. A <em>constructive</em> proof is, or is readily turned into, an algorithm to find the thing it‚Äôs claiming.</p><p>It is easier to understand constructivism by looking at what procedures in proofs are not constructive. Here is a theorem in elementary calculus:</p><p><strong>Theorem</strong>. There exist <span>$\{a, b\} ‚äÜ \mathbf{R}^+ - \mathbf{Q}^+$</span> such that <span>$a^b ‚àà \mathbf{Q}^+$</span>. (There are two irrational numbers <span>$a$</span>, <span>$b$</span> with <span>$a^b$</span> rational.)</p><p>Here is a non-constructive proof:</p><p><strong>Proof</strong>. Consider <span>$\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}$</span>. If it is rational, we are done. Otherwise, <span>$\sqrt{2}^{\left(\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}\right)} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2$</span> is rational, and we are done.</p><p>This proof is classically valid. But imagine we needed these numbers <span>$a$</span>, <span>$b$</span> for the correctness of some algorithm. Which numbers would we use: <span>$a = b = \sqrt{2}$</span> or <span>$a = \sqrt{2}$</span> and <span>$b = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$</span>? Here shows the difficulty of a non-constructive proof: while it makes the claim that the requested numbers <span>$a$</span> and <span>$b$</span> exist, it does not give any way to construct those numbers. Thus it is unsuitable for algorithmic purposes.</p><p>Here is a constructive proof.</p><p><strong>Proof</strong>. Let <span>$a = \sqrt{2}$</span> and <span>$b = \frac{\log{9}}{\log{2}}$</span>. Then <span>$a^b = 3$</span> which is rational, and we are done.</p><p>This proof is constructive because we can immediately use it in any algorithm requesting such numbers <span>$a$</span> and <span>$b$</span>, as they are constructed in the proof.</p><p>Let us try to turn the first proof into an algorithm, so we can better see what goes wrong.</p><pre><code class="language-julia"># Compute `a, b` where `a` and `b` are irrationals such that `a^b` is rational.

if (‚àö2) ^ (‚àö2) ‚àà ùêê
    a = ‚àö2
    b = ‚àö2
else
    a = ‚àö2
    b = (‚àö2) ^ (‚àö2)
end</code></pre><p>If we try to implement this algorithm, we see immediately what is wrong: implementing the condition <code>(‚àö2) ^ (‚àö2) ‚àà ùêê</code> is hard. To have such an algorithm that can determine whether <code>(‚àö2) ^ (‚àö2)</code> is rational, we would need to prove that it is rational, or that it is irrational.</p><p>Note that in a non-constructive logic, the proof was valid because we could simply assume that a correct decision can be made ‚Äî though the proof does not tell us how to make it. This is called the  Law of the Excluded Middle, an inference rule of non-constructive mathematics:</p><div>\[‚ä¢ P ‚à® ¬¨P\]</div><p>The Law of the Excluded Middle, from an algorithmic standpoint, is equivalent to omniscience. If for any proposition <span>$P$</span> we had an algorithm that determines the truth of <span>$P$</span>, then using this law is valid constructively ‚Äî as we would simply ask that algorithm which branch to take.</p><p>Unfortunately, modern computers do not support omniscience, so the Law of the Excluded Middle cannot be used in constructive proofs.</p><h2>Limited Omniscience</h2><p>Let‚Äôs imagine we want to repair the technique used above to be valid, constructively. What additional powers would we need?</p><p>Imagine we had an omniscient oracle that could tell us, given any proposition <span>$P$</span>, whether it were true or not. Then in fact the ‚Äúnon-constructive‚Äù proof above does give the required <span>$a$</span> and <span>$b$</span>: we would just have to ask the oracle once the question <span>$\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2} ‚àà \mathbf{Q}^+$</span>.</p><h2>Logic</h2><p>There is not a single theory of constructivism; different mathematicians have developed different approaches. Many modern mathematicians subscribe to a theory of constructivism built on intuitionistic logic: in particular, the BHK interpretation.</p></div><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li><a class="tag-link tag-analysis" href="/tag/analysis/">analysis</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-logic" href="/tag/logic/">logic</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-constructive-mathematics" href="/tag/constructive-mathematics/">constructive mathematics</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-real-analysis" href="/tag/real-analysis/">real analysis</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-intuitionistic-logic" href="/tag/intuitionistic-logic/">intuitionistic logic</a></li></ul></article></main></body></html>
