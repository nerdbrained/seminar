 ``` 
 `C`` is the
stereotypical Cantor set.

An interesting property is that this set has measure zero, and is
uncountable. Let’s define what measure zero is.

For all ``\varepsilon &gt; 0`` there exists a sequence of intervals ``\{U_n\}``
such that ``A \subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} U_n`` and that
``\sum_{n =1}^{\infty} {\left|U_n\right|} &lt; \infty`` where we naturally
define the length of an interval as
``{\left|(a,b)\right|} = {\left|[a,b]\right|} = b - a``.

How do we show that that Cantor set is uncountable? Well we have a
surjection to the set of ternary numbers. Every number in the cantor set
can represented as a ternary number without 1 in any of it’s digits
(Since 1 represents the removed middle third). Look this up on Google.

In order to measure and compare the Cantor set with other fractal, we
utilize something called the Hausdorff dimension.

The Hausdorff dimension is defined by first taking the Hausdorff content
which is defined as
\]</div><p>math  C_H^{d}(S) = \inf \Big{ \sum_{i} r_i^d : r_i \text{ are balls covering S} \Big}``` and then we define </p><div>\[ \text{dim}_H(X) = \inf\{d \geq 1 : C_H^{d} = 0\}
 ``` 
 This is not easy to calculate, we are going to use a shortcut.

It is not hard to see that ``C = C/3 \cup (2/3 + C/3)`` and
``C/3 \cap (2/3 \cap C/3) = {\varnothing}``. A shortcut is taking the
Hausdorff measure as follows,
\]</div><p>math  H^{t}(C) = H^{t}(C/3) + H^{t}(1/3C + 2/3) = 2H^{t}(C/3)</p><pre><code class="language-none"></code></pre><p>math  H^{t}(C) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}^{t}H^{t}(C)```</p><div>\[ 1=2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}^{t}
 ``` 
 so 
 ```math
 t = \frac{\log 2}{\log 3}
 ``` 
 hus, the
cantor set has dimension ``\frac{\log 2}{\log 3}``!

Note that above we assumed that ``H^{t}(C)``, ``H^{t}(C/3)`` and
``H^{t}(1/3C + 2/3)`` is finite – this is a reasonable assumption but we
will not justify why this is the case here. So take it for granted for
now.

Dynamical Systems
=================

Let’s talk about Dynamical Systems. They are systems that describe that
values through time. A Chaotic dynamical system is a dynamical system
which is very sensitive to initial conditions – even a small change in
initial conditions results in a huge change in outcome. An example of a
chaotic dynamical system is a double pendulum – look this up!

Cantor sets are related to dynamical systems! Let’s describe this.

Let’s consider the following set of functions for
``u \in {{\mathbf{R}}}\]</div><p>math  ``f_{u}(x) = u x(1 -x)</p><pre><code class="language-none"> This equation looks nice
but it is not. When ``u \geq 2 + \sqrt {5}`` the above equation messes a
lot of things up. Let’s define
</code></pre><p>math  \Lambda_n = {x \in [0,1] :  f_u^{n}(x) \in [0,1]}</p><pre><code class="language-none"> and then define
</code></pre><p>math  \Lambda = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\Lambda_n</p><pre><code class="language-none"> This is the set of
``x \in [0,1]`` such that ``f_u(x)`` is in ``[0,1]`` which can be repeatedly
applied and it stays in ``[0,1]``.

This is a Cantor set! But I forgot to give a definition of a cantor set
before so let’s give the definition here.

A Cantor set is closed and bounded, perfect and has no intervals.

In order to show that that set is a Cantor set, let’s prove the
following lemma.

In ``\Lambda_n``, all intervals are bounded above in length by
``\frac{1}{t}`` for some ``t &gt; 1``.

If x is in ``\Lambda_1``, then ``f^\prime(x)`` is greater than or equal to
the absolute value of the derivative of ``f(x)`` at
</code></pre><p>math  \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{u^2 -4u}}{2u} ```   In this way we get the t which we’re looking for. The second part of the lemma can be proved using a contradiction with the first part of the lemma and the mean value theorem.</p><p><span>$\Lambda$</span> is a Cantor Set.</p><p><span>$\Lambda$</span> is clearly closed and bounded because it is an intersection of closed sets.</p><p>If you look at the Cantor middle third set, we know for sure that the endpoints of the intervals are in the Cantor set. Something similar happens in our case.</p><p>For <span>$x \in \Lambda$</span> and for all <span>$\varepsilon &gt; 0$</span> we can find <span>$n$</span> such that <span>$1/t^n &lt; \varepsilon$</span>. And we can find two boundary points which are close to <span>$x$</span> by looking at <span>$\Lambda_n$</span>.</p><p>And for the third property, given interval of length <span>$\varepsilon$</span> we can find <span>$n$</span> such that <span>$1/t^n &lt; \varepsilon$</span>.</p><h1>Chaos</h1><p>How does this relate to Chaos? Suppose we have a point <span>$x$</span> and we apply <span>$f$</span> to it a many times. Since <span>$x \in \Lambda$</span>, <span>$f^{n}(x)$</span> is mapped to a point in <span>$[0,1]$</span> for each <span>$n \in {{\mathbf{N}}}$</span>. Since <span>$\Lambda$</span> contains no intervals, there is a point close to <span>$x$</span> which is not in <span>$\Lambda$</span>. So there is a small <span>$y$</span> such that <span>$F^k(x + y) \not\in [0,1]$</span> for some large enough <span>$k$</span>. But since <span>$\Lambda$</span> is perfect, there is some point very close to <span>$x$</span> (but not <span>$x$</span>), say <span>$x + z$</span> where <span>$z$</span> is very small such that <span>$f^l(z) \not \in [0,1]$</span> for large enough <span>$l$</span>.</p><p>This is an example of chaos because in our case we can move <span>$x$</span> a tiny amount and get wild changes in <span>$f$</span>. It is a similar idea to the phrase “a Butterfly flapping its wings in New Mexico causes a hurricane in China” as even there a small change in initial conditions causes a huge change in the outcome.</p><p>In our case, since the invariant of <span>$f$</span> is a cantor set, the behavior of the system is sensitive to very small changes. This can be used to prove that <span>$f$</span> is topologically transitive on the set <span>$\Lambda$</span> and is then used to prove that the whole function is chaotic.</p><p>For an extension on this topic, a useful source is the below publishing.</p><p>Holmgren, Richard A.
