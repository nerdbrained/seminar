The speaker was Kai RÃ¼sch.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>How do we count how many holes a shape has?

They are called <strong>affinely linearly independent</strong> if <span>$v^1 - v^0,\dots,v^n - v^0$</span> are linearly independent. By convention if <span>$n= 0$</span> then <span>$v^0$</span> is affinely linearly independent even if its 0.</p><p>Let <span>$v^0,\dots,v^n$</span> be vectors in <span>$\euc{N}$</span>. A vector <span>$v$</span> is said to be <strong>affinely dependent</strong> on them if there exist real numbers <span>$\lambda_0,\dots,\lambda_n$</span> such that</p><div>\[\lambda_1 + \dots + \lambda_n = 1 \textrm { and } v = \lambda_0v^0 + \dots
\lambda_nv^n\]</div><p>Let <span>$v^0,\dots,v^n$</span> be a-independent. The <strong>(closed) simplex</strong> with vertices <span>$v^0,\dots,v^n$</span> is the set of points a-dependent on <span>$v^0,\dots,v^n$</span> and with every barycentric coordinate greater than or equal to 0. The simplex is said to be <strong>spanned</strong> by <span>$v^0,\dots,v^n$</span>. The points with barycentric coordinate greater than 0 are said to be the <strong>interior</strong> of the simplex, and the set of interior points is sometimes called the <strong>open simplex</strong> with vertices <span>$v^0,\dots,v^n$</span>. The <strong>boundary</strong> of the simplex consists of those points which are not interior. We denote a (closed) simplex with a-indepenent vertices <span>$v^0,\dots,v^n$</span> by <span>$(v^0\dots v^n)$</span> and often represent it by a symbol <span>$s_n$</span> or just <span>$s$</span>. The integer <span>$n$</span> is called the <strong>dimension</strong> of <span>$(v^0 \dots v^n)$</span>. A simplex of dimension <span>$n$</span> is called an <span>$n$</span>-simplex.</p><p>Let <span>$s_n = (v^1 \dots v^n)$</span> be a simplex. A <strong>face</strong> of <span>$s_n$</span> is a simplex whose vertices form a (non-empty) subset of <span>$\{v^0,\dots,v^n\}$</span>. If the subset is proper we say the face is a <strong>proper face</strong>. If <span>$s_p$</span> is a face of <span>$s_n$</span> we write <span>$s_p &lt; s_n$</span> or <span>$s_n &gt; s_p$</span>. Note <span>$s_n &lt; s_n$</span> for any simplex <span>$s_n$</span>.</p><h3>Ordered and Oriented Simplexes</h3><p>Let <span>$s_n = (v^0 \dots v^n)$</span> be a simplex. An <strong>orientation</strong> for <span>$s_n$</span> is a collection of orderings for the vertices consisting of a particular ordering and all even permuations of it. An <strong>oriented n-simplex</strong> <span>$\sigma_n$</span> is an <span>$n$</span>-simplex <span>$s_n$</span>, together with an orientation for <span>$s_n$</span>.</p><p>We write <span>$\sigma_n = (v^0 \dots v^n)$</span> to mean <span>$\sigma_n$</span> is the oriented <span>$n$</span>-simplex with vertices <span>$(v^0,\dots,v^n)$</span> and orientation given by the ordering displayed and all even permutations of it. It will always be clear from the context wether <span>$(v^0 \dots v^n)$</span> means simplex or orientated simplex. When <span>$n &gt; 0$</span> we write <span>$-\sigma_n$</span> for the oriented simplex consisting of the same <span>$n$</span>-simplex and the collection of other possible orderings of the vertices. Thus by definition <span>$-(-\sigma_n) = \sigma_n$</span>.</p><h3>Simplical Complexes</h3><p>A <strong>simplical complex</strong> is a finite set <span>$K$</span> of simplexes in <span>$\euc{N}$</span> with the following two properties:</p><pre><code class="language-none">- if ``s \in K`` and ``t &lt; s`` (``t`` is a face of ``s``) then ``t \in s``

- intersection condition: if ``s \in K`` and ``t \in K`` then ``s \cap t`` is
  either empty or else a face of both ``s`` and ``t``</code></pre><p>The <strong>dimension</strong> of <span>$K$</span> is the largest dimension of any simplex in <span>$K$</span>. The <strong>underlying space</strong> of <span>$K$</span>, denoted <span>$\abs{K}$</span>, is the set of points in <span>$\euc{N}$</span> which belong to at least one simplex of <span>$K$</span>.</p><p>A <strong>subcomplex</strong> of a simplical complex <span>$K$</span> is a subset <span>$L$</span> of <span>$K$</span> which is itself a simplical complex. (This is if and only if <span>$L$</span> has the property that)</p><div>\[s \in L \land t &lt; s \Rightarrow t \in L\]</div><p>The subcomplex is called <strong>proper</strong> if <span>$L \neq K$</span>.</p><p>An <strong>oriented simplical complex</strong> is a simplical complex in which every simplex is provided an orientation.</p><h3>Abstract Simplicial Complexes</h3><p>An <strong>abstract simplical complex</strong> is a pair <span>$X = (V,S)$</span> where <span>$V$</span> is a finite set whose elements are called the <strong>vertices</strong> of <span>$X$</span> and <span>$S$</span> is a set of non-empty subsets of <span>$V$</span>. Each element <span>$s \in S$</span> is called a <strong>simplex</strong> of <span>$X$</span> and if <span>$s \in S$</span> has precisely <span>$n+1$</span> elements, <span>$s$</span> is called an <span>$n$</span>-simplex. <span>$S$</span> is required to statisfy the following two conditions</p><ol><li><p><span>$v \in V \Rightarrow \{v\} \in S$</span></p></li><li><p><span>$s \in S, t\subset s \Rightarrow t \in S$</span></p></li></ol><p>The <strong>dimension</strong> of <span>$X$</span> is so long as <span>$V \neq \emptyset$</span> the largest <span>$n$</span> for which <span>$S$</span> contains an <span>$n$</span>-simplex.</p><p>Two abstract simplical complexes <span>$X = (V,S), X' = (V',S')$</span> are said to be <strong>isomorphic</strong> if there is a bijection <span>$f: V \rightarrow V'$</span> with the property that</p><div>\[\{v^0,\dots,v^n\} \in S \Leftrightarrow \{f(x^0),\dots,f(x^n)\} \in S'\]</div><p>A <strong>realization</strong> of an abstract simplical complex <span>$X$</span> is a simplical complex whose corresponding abstract simplical complex is isomorphic to <span>$X$</span>.</p><p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Every abstract simplical complex of dimension <span>$n$</span> has a realization in <span>$\euc{2n + 1}$</span>.</p><h3>Chain Groups and Boundary Homomorphisms</h3><p>Let <span>$K$</span> be an oriented simplical complex of dimension <span>$n$</span>, and let <span>$\alpha_p$</span> be the number of <span>$p$</span>-simplexes of <span>$K$</span>. For <span>$0 \leq p \leq n$</span> let <span>$\sigma_p^1,\dots,\sigma_p^{\alpha_p}$</span> be the oriented <span>$p$</span>-simplexes of <span>$K$</span>; for such <span>$p$</span> the <span>$p$</span>th chain group of <span>$K$</span>, denoted <span>$C_p(K)$</span> is the free abelian group on the set <span>$\{\sigma_p^1,\dots,\sigma_p^{\alpha_p}\}$</span>. Thus an element of <span>$C_p(K)$</span> is a linear combination</p><div>\[\lambda_1\sigma_p^1 + \dots + \lambda_{\alpha_p}\sigma_p^{\alpha_p}\]</div><p>with <span>$\lambda$</span>'s integers. This is called a <span>$p$</span>-chain on <span>$K$</span> and two <span>$p$</span>-chains are added by adding the corresponding coefficients. When writing down <span>$p$</span>-chains it is customary to omit <span>$p$</span>-simplexes whose coefficient is zero, unless they are all zero, in which case we write 0.</p><p>Let <span>$\sigma = (v^0 \dots v^p)$</span> be an oriented <span>$p$</span>-simplex of <span>$K$</span> for some <span>$p &gt; 0$</span>. The <strong>boundary</strong> of <span>$\sigma$</span> is the <span>$(p-1)$</span>-chain</p><div>\[\partial \sigma = \partial_p \sigma = \sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^i(v_0 \dots \hat{v^i}
\dots v^p)\]</div><p>For <span>$p = 0$</span> the boundary is defined to be 0. The <strong>boundary homomorphism</strong> <span>$\partial = \partial_p : C_p(K) \rightarrow C_{p-1}(K)$</span> is defined by</p><div>\[\partial_p(\Sigma\lambda_i\sigma_p^i) = \Sigma\lambda_i\partial_p(\sigma_p^i)\]</div><p>for <span>$0 \leq p \leq n$</span> and is defined to be the trivial homomorphism otherwise.</p><p>The <strong>augmentation</strong></p><div>\[\epsilon : C_0(K) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\]</div><p>is the homomorphism defined by</p><div>\[\epsilon(\Sigma\lambda_i\sigma_0^i) = \Sigma\lambda_i\]</div><p>the sequences</p><div>\[\dots 0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow C_n(K) \xrightarrow{\partial} C_{n-1}(K)

C_{p-2}(K)\]</div><p>is trivial. Also <span>$\epsilon \circ \partial_1:C_1(K) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$</span> is trivial.</p><p><strong>Corollary</strong>: For any <span>$p$</span></p><div>\[\Ima \partial_{p+1} \subset \Ker \partial_p\]</div><p>and also</p><div>\[\Ima \partial_p \subset \Ker \epsilon\]</div><h3>Homology Groups</h3><p>Consider the sequence</p><div>\[C_{p+1}(K) \xrightarrow{\partial_{p+1}} C_p(K) \xrightarrow{\partial_p}
\rightarrow C_{p-1}(K)\]</div><p><span>$\Ker \partial_p$</span> is denoted by <span>$Z_p$</span> or <span>$Z_p(K)$</span> and the elements of <span>$Z_p$</span> are called <span>$p$</span>-cycles. <span>$Z_p$</span> is a free, finitely generated group. <span>$\Ima \partial_{p+1}$</span> is denoted by <span>$B_p$</span> or <span>$B_p(K)$</span> and the elements of <span>$B_p$</span> are called <span>$p$</span>-boundaries. <span>$B_p$</span> is a free finitely generated group.</p><p>Since <span>$B_p \subset Z_p$</span> there is a quotient group <span>$H_p(K) = Z_p / B_p(K)$</span> called the <span>$p$</span>th <strong>homology group</strong> of <span>$K$</span>.</p><p>The quotient group <span>$\Ker \epsilon / B_0(K)$</span> is denoted <span>$\tilde{H}_0(K)$</span> and is called the <strong>reduced zeroth homology group</strong> of <span>$K$</span>.</p><p>An element of <span>$H_p(K)$</span> is a coset <span>$\bar{z} = z + B_p(K)$</span> where <span>$z \in Z_p(K)$</span>. We use the notation <span>$\{z\}$</span> for this coset. It is called the <strong>homology class</strong> of the cycle <span>$z$</span>. Any cycle <span>$z' \in \{z\}$</span> is called a <strong>representative cycle</strong> for <span>$\{z\}$</span>. We say that <span>$z$</span> and <span>$z'$</span> are <strong>homologous</strong> if <span>$z - z' \in B_p(K)$</span> and write <span>$z \sim z'$</span></p><p><strong>Proposition</strong>: <span>$v \sim v'$</span> if and only <span>$v$</span> and <span>$v'$</span> lie in the same connected component of <span>$K$</span></p><p><strong>Proposition</strong>: Let <span>$K$</span> be a non-empty oriented simplical complex with <span>$k$</span> components <span>$K_1,\dots,K_k$</span> and let <span>$v^i$</span> be a vertex in <span>$K_i$</span>. Then <span>$H_0(K)$</span> is freely generated by the homology class <span>$\{v^i\}$</span> for <span>$i = 1,\dots,k$</span>.
