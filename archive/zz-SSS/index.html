The speaker was Zihao Zhu.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>As more and more sensitive data gets digitized, there is a need to ensure privacy  and reliability of the data, especially in the face of adversarial parties who  attempt to corrupt or unwanted access to sensitive secrets.</p><p>In many instances such as online gambling, bidding, and even Google's targeted  advertisements, a client wants to be able to take inputs from multiple sources  (for example, auction bids) and produce an output (for example, the highest bidder) without revealing any information about the other inputs.  We will use such  scenarios as well as more cryptography related ones in order to motivate  Multi-Party Computation as a method to compute on encrypted data.  With MPC, we  will quickly see it's limitations with unsecure channels and first develop secret  sharing schemes (specifically linear secret sharing schemes) such as Shamir's  scheme, and soon after, verifiable secret sharing schemes.</p><p>We will introduce the different types of adversarial structures and explore both  the robustness and limitations of secret sharing schemes against them.</p><p>Finally, we will show that all Linear Secret Sharing Schemes can be constructed  to be verifiable.  We will explore the consequences of this and discuss techniques in their construction.</p><p>Prereqs: Math136 used in proofs</p></div><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li><a class="tag-link tag-computer-science" href="/tag/computer-science">computer science</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-cryptography" href="/tag/cryptography">cryptography</a></li></ul></article></section></body></html>
