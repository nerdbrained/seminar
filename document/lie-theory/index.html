It covers a subset of the material of PMATH 763.</p><div><h2>Geometry of complex numbers and the Quaternions</h2><p>The main aim of this section is to study groups of linear transformations (the orthogonal transformations) by representing them as matrix groups. The group of all rotations on <span>$\mathbb{R}^2$</span> is denoted <span>$SO(2)$</span>, for the &quot;special orthogonal&quot; linear transformations from <span>$\mathbb{R}^2$</span> to <span>$\mathbb{R}^2$</span>. When represented as matrices, they have the property that their determinant is 1, and that <span>$AA^t=A^tA=I$</span>, which also means that they admit a basis of eigenvectors.</p><p>We consider the rotation matrix on <span>$\mathbb{R}^2$</span>.</p><div>\[R_θ =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(θ) &amp; -\sin(θ) \\
\sin(θ) &amp; \cos(θ)
\end{pmatrix}  = \cos(θ)
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}  + \sin(θ)
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\]</div><p>Defining the first matrix to be <span>$\mathbf{1}$</span>, and the second to be <span>$\mathbf{i}$</span>, we get the regular identities fro complex numbers. We also see that for any complex number <span>$z=a\mathbf{1}+b\mathbf{i}$</span>, we can write</p><div>\[z=\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; -b \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}\]</div><p>and</p><div>\[|z| = \det \begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; -b \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix} = a^2+b^2 = |a+bi|\]</div><p>We can try a similar process over <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span>, One thought is to associate them with a <span>$2× 2$</span> matrix over <span>$\mathbb{C}$</span>. We want all of the matrices to rotate the vector <span>$(1,0)^t$</span> in orthogonal ways (under the standard inner product on <span>$\mathbb{R}^n$</span>)</p><div>\[\begin{align*}
z
&amp;=a\mathbf{1}+b\mathbf{i}+c\mathbf{j} + d\mathbf{k} \\
&amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
a+di &amp; -b-ci \\
b-ci &amp; a-di
\end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;= a\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} + b
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}  +c
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -i \\
-i &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}  +d
\begin{pmatrix}
i &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -i
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}\]</div><p>Now, consider the purely imaginary quaternions <span>$\rho = b\mathbf{i}+c\mathbf{j}+d\mathbf{k}$</span>, which are the orthogonal compliments to the real quaternions <span>$a\mathbf{1}$</span>. For a purely imaginary product, we see that</p><div>\[\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}= \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}× \mathbf{v}\]</div><p>We notice that this product is algebraically closed when <span>$\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}=0$</span>, meaning <span>$\mathbf{u}$</span> and <span>$\mathbf{v}$</span> are orthogonal. There is some interesting matrix algebra related to the representation of complex numbers, and the quaternions. Notice that if we take the conjugate of <span>$a+bi$</span> we get <span>$a-bi$</span>, which has the matrix representation</p><div>\[\overline{z}=
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; b \\
-b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
 = z^t\]</div><p>And for the quaternion conjugate <span>$\overline{z}=a\mathbf{1}-b\mathbf{i}-c\mathbf{j}-d\mathbf{k}$</span>, we have</p><div>\[\overline{z}=
\begin{pmatrix}
a-di &amp; b+ci \\
-b+ci &amp; a+di
\end{pmatrix} = z^{*}\]</div><p>This means that for quaternions (as they are not commutative) <span>$\overline{z_1z_2}=\bar{z_2}\bar{z_1}$</span>. Consider unit quaternions in the form <span>$z=\cos(θ)+u\sin(θ)$</span>, where <span>$u$</span> is a pure complex quaternion. A rotation through the angle <span>$θ$</span> can be defined as <span>$t^{-1}zt$</span>, where <span>$t=\cos(θ/2)+u\sin(θ)$</span>. This is a rotation by theta through the axis <span>$u$</span> in <span>$\mathbb{R}^3$</span>. The same rotation is induced by <span>$-t$</span>, as <span>$(-t)^{-1}z(-t)=t^{-1}zt$</span>. Thus rotations in <span>$\mathbb{R}^3$</span> are induced by pairs of antipodal unit quaternions.</p><p>It is also useful to be able to talk about reflections in terms of quaternions as well. A Reflection in the hyperplane <span>$O$</span> which is orthogonal to the unit quaternion <span>$u$</span> is a map which sends each <span>$q∈ \mathbb{R}^4$</span>  to <span>$-u\bar{q}u$</span>. A linear map is called orientation preserving if its matrix representation has a positive determinant, and orientation reversing otherwise. Based on this map, reflections are orientation reversing. Rotations about <span>$O$</span> are orientation preserving isometries which fix <span>$O$</span>. By the Cartan-Dieudonné theorem, every rotation in an <span>$n$</span> dimensional symmetric bilinear space can be represented by the product of at most n reflections. Since the determinant of a reflection is negative, this shows that in <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span> every rotation is the product of 0, 2, or 4 reflections. If the form of the reflection is considered, it is easy to see that a rotation is a map <span>$q\mapsto vqw$</span> for unit quaternions <span>$v,w$</span>.</p><h2>Groups</h2><p>The unit quaternions are usually denoted by the set <span>$\mathbb{S}^{3}$</span>, as they define a sphere in <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span>. Each unit quaternion was shown to be equivalent to the set of all complex matrices in the form</p><div>\[Q= \begin{pmatrix}
a+di &amp; -b-ci \\
b-ci &amp; a-di
\end{pmatrix}  \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \textrm{where}  \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \det Q =1\]</div><p>This group is usually denoted <span>$\textrm{SU}(2)$</span>, for the <span>$2× 2$</span> special unitary matrices. The related group <span>$\textrm{SO}(3)$</span>, or the group of all rotations in <span>$\mathbb{R}^3$</span>, is somewhat of a refinement on <span>$\textrm{SU}(2)$</span>. Unit quaternions correspond to rotations of <span>$\mathbb{R}^3$</span>, with antipodal pares of quaternions giving rise to the same rotation in <span>$\mathbb{R}^3$</span>. This suggests that it is possible to construct a 2-1 homomorphism from <span>$\textrm{SU}(2)$</span> to <span>$\textrm{SO}(3)$</span>.</p><p>A useful property of groups is that many of them may be represented as a direct product of groups <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span> under the product of pairs operation <span>$(a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2)=(a_1a_2,b_1,b_2)$</span>. An example of this kind of group is <span>$\mathbb{R}^n$</span> with vector addition. Another interesting example is the group of <span>$n× n$</span> matrices. If <span>$A,B∈ \mathbb{M}_{n× n}(\mathbb{F})$</span>, then We can write all elements in <span>$A× B$</span> in the form</p><div>\[\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{0} &amp; b
\end{pmatrix}  \, \, \, \, \, \textrm{such that } a∈ A \, \, \, b∈ B\]</div><p>Since the elements of <span>$\mathbb{R}$</span> are isomorphic to the group of matrices</p><div>\[\left\{\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; x \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} :  \, \, \, \, \, x∈ \mathbb{R} \right\}\]</div><p>It follows that <span>$\mathbb{R}^n$</span> is isomorphic to a group of <span>$2n× 2n$</span> matrices. Replacing <span>$\mathbb{R}$</span> by <span>$\mathbb{S}^2$</span> gives a similar isomorphism with <span>$θ$</span> in place for <span>$x$</span>. The group <span>$\mathbb{S}^1× \mathbb{S}^1$</span> is called the unit torus, as for <span>$θ, ϕ∈ \mathbb{S}^1$</span>, we can specify a point <span>$(θ, ϕ)$</span> which corresponds to a point on the surface of the torus moving <span>$θ$</span> radians across along the outside edge, and <span>$ϕ$</span> along the inside edge. This group is denoted <span>$\mathbb{T}^2$</span>  (figure 1).</p><p><img src="/seminar/images/torus.jpg" alt="Torus"/></p><p><span>$\mathbb{S}^2×\mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{T}^2$</span></p><p>Since <span>$\mathbb{R}$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{S}^1$</span> are abelian groups, their products are abelian as well. It can be shown with some work that <span>$\mathbb{R}^m× \mathbb{T}^n$</span> for <span>$m,n∈ \mathbb{N}$</span> include all connected abelian matrix Lie groups. (Note that <span>$\mathbb{S}^n$</span> is not associated with a Cartesian product the way that <span>$\mathbb{R}^n$</span> is, and <span>$\mathbb{T}^n\ncong\mathbb{S}^n$</span>).</p><p>Now, we can try classifying rotations in <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span> (the group SO(4)) by associating them with the group SU(2). Recall that all rotations can be represented by the form <span>$q\mapsto vqw$</span>, but since if <span>$v$</span> is a quaternion, then <span>$v^{-1}$</span> exists, so there is no harm in defining the map to instead be <span>$q\mapsto v^{-1}qw$</span>. With this in mind, consider the group <span>$\textrm{SU}(2)× \textrm{SU}(2)$</span>. There is a homomorphism from <span>$\textrm{SU}(2)× \textrm{SU}(2)$</span> to <span>$\textrm{SO}(4)$</span> which takes <span>$(v,w)∈ \textrm{SU}(2)× \textrm{SU}(2)$</span> to <span>$f(q)=v^{-1}qw$</span>. We again encounter the antipodal pares which produce the same rotation, so the homomorphism has a kernel of two elements. It is possible to find a nontrivial subgroup of <span>$\textrm{SO}(4)$</span> which is normal by considering the image of the subgroup of points <span>$(v,1)$</span> in <span>$\textrm{SU}(2)× \textrm{SU}(2)$</span>. This means that <span>$\textrm{SO}(4)$</span> is not simple.</p><h2>Why are we talking about this?</h2><p>In 1870, Sophus Lie was studying the symmetries of differential equations, which generally form &quot;continuous&quot; groups. The analogous problem for polynomials was solved by Galois previously, so there was incentive to solve the related problem for these new kinds of groups. This lead to a study of simplicity in these continuous groups. Lie understood these groups as groups generated by infinitesimal elements, which lead him to believe that <span>$\textrm{SO}(n)$</span> should be generalised to consider infinitesimal rotations.  Today we separate the infinitesimal rotations out into a group <span>$\mathfrak{so}(n)$</span> called the <strong>Lie Algebra</strong> of <span>$\textrm{SO}(n)$</span>.  Similarly, the infinitesimal elements of a group G form a Lie algebra <span>$\mathfrak{g}$</span>, which captures most of the important structures of G, but is easier to handle. Using this notion of a generalise group, Lie was able to prove simplicity for all but a finite number of Lie algebras — namely those of the exceptional groups.</p></div><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li><a class="tag-link tag-algebra" href="/tag/algebra/">algebra</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-group-theory" href="/tag/group-theory/">group theory</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-lie-group" href="/tag/lie-group/">Lie group</a></li><li><a class="tag-link tag-linear-algebra" href="/tag/linear-algebra/">linear algebra</a></li></ul></article><footer><p>Help improve this page by <a href="https://github.com/wumss/seminar/edit/master/document/lie-theory">editing it on GitHub</a>.</p></footer></main></body></html>
