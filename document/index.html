There are no official prerequisites for this talk, but MATH 145 and MATH 146 are an asset. The group theory part of the talk will mostly be based on <a href="http://mathcamp.org/2015/abel/abel.pdf">Alekseev, 2004</a>, specifically sections 1.1 (motivation), 1.2 (transformation groups), 1.5, 1.9, and 1.13 (various morphisms), and 1.11 (quotient groups).</p><p>Due to time constraints, it is inevitable that some content must be rushed. I will not go over proofs and derivations in full rigour, and I highly advise studying the reference material after the talk to catch up on what you may have missed. Please message me in advance if there are any other subjects in particular that you would like me to discuss.</p><a href="/archive/fw-Algebra">A summary of this talk is available here.</a><h3><a href="/archive/kt-GameTheory">Game Theory (Part 1)</a></h3><p>Delivered by Koosha Totonchi on Friday November 4, 2016</p><p>A game is a “mathematical model between interacting decision makers” where each player must make choices based on a set of rules. Every individual in a game must also have a preferred reaction to any combination of actions taken by other agents.  Game theory is about the study and application of these models. It involves various solution concepts and methods that can be employed to predict the outcomes of strategic engagements.  This talk will introduce the major ideas in the field. There will be a focus on basic definitions, types of games, and how we can “solve games” using the Nash equilibrium. Hopefully we’ll get to “play” some ourselves. Towards the end, we can also review some neat unsolved problems in game theory that are very easy to understand, but prove really difficult to solve. </p><a href="/archive/kt-GameTheory">A summary of this talk is available here.</a><h3><a href="/archive/kr-Graphs">Simplicial Homology</a></h3><p>Delivered by Kai Rüsch on Friday November 11, 2016</p><p>How do we count how many holes a shape has? We can answer this question using homology groups, whose order's count the number of <span>$n$</span>-dimensional holes.</p><a href="/archive/kr-Graphs">A summary of this talk is available here.</a><h3><a href="/archive/fw-Hypercomplex">Hypercomplex Numbers</a></h3><p>Delivered by Fengyang Wang on Friday November 18, 2016</p><p>There are exactly three distinct two-dimensional unital algebras over the reals, up to isomorphism. Each of these algebras corresponds to a unique geometry, with applications. This talk will develop the concepts needed to understand two-dimensional algebras over the reals, starting from the definitions of key concepts. We will rediscover the familiar complex numbers and generalize its construction to find the other hypercomplex number systems. We will then prove the result that these are the unique hypercomplex number systems, up to isomorphism. Finally, we will discuss possible generalizations to <span>$n$</span> dimensions. Please ensure that you have a good understanding of fundamental concepts of <a href="/document/2d-linear-algebra">two-dimensional linear algebra</a>.</p><p>We will use <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00006-004-0008-2">Catoni, F., Cannata, R., Catoni, V., &amp; Zampetti, P. (2004)</a> as a reference.</p><a href="/archive/fw-Hypercomplex">A summary of this talk is available here.</a><h3><a href="/archive/fw-q">$q$-analogs</a></h3><p>Delivered by Fengyang Wang on Friday February 3, 2017</p><p>Some of the most interesting results in combinatorics are generalizations of simple problems or theorems to problems or theorems parameterized by a parameter <span>$q$</span> (often complex-valued). By taking the limit as <span>$q\to1$</span>, the simple problems can be recovered. Surprisingly, many of these <span>$q$</span>-analogs take similar forms, and are seen across a wide variety of problems that may initially seem unrelated.</p><p>Concepts from MATH 239 will be used. It is heavily recommended that people who have not taken MATH 239 or an equivalent course read some <a href="/document/ordinary-generating-functions">material on ordinary generating functions</a>.</p><a href="/archive/fw-q">A summary of this talk is available here.</a><h3><a href="/archive/eo-Ordinals">Ordinals</a></h3><p>Delivered by Eddie Onochie on Friday February 10, 2017</p><p>In this talk we will talk about ordinals and the philosophy of infinity. We will define what ordinals are and how to construct them. We will also define transfinite recursion and use the axiom of choice to give meaning to the "cardinality" of a set.</p><a href="/archive/eo-Ordinals">A summary of this talk is available here.</a><h3><a href="/archive/zz-SSS">General Secure Multi-Party Computation from any Linear Secret-Sharing Scheme</a></h3><p>Delivered by Zihao Zhu on Friday February 17, 2017</p><p>As more and more sensitive data gets digitized, there is a need to ensure privacy  and reliability of the data, especially in the face of adversarial parties who  attempt to corrupt or unwanted access to sensitive secrets.</p><p>In many instances such as online gambling, bidding, and even Google's targeted  advertisements, a client wants to be able to take inputs from multiple sources  (for example, auction bids) and produce an output (for example, the highest bidder) without revealing any information about the other inputs.  We will use such  scenarios as well as more cryptography related ones in order to motivate  Multi-Party Computation as a method to compute on encrypted data.  With MPC, we  will quickly see it's limitations with unsecure channels and first develop secret  sharing schemes (specifically linear secret sharing schemes) such as Shamir's  scheme, and soon after, verifiable secret sharing schemes.</p><p>We will introduce the different types of adversarial structures and explore both  the robustness and limitations of secret sharing schemes against them.</p><p>Finally, we will show that all Linear Secret Sharing Schemes can be constructed  to be verifiable.  We will explore the consequences of this and discuss techniques in their construction.</p><p>Prereqs: Math136 used in proofs</p><a href="/archive/zz-SSS">A summary of this talk is available here.</a></article><footer><p>Help improve this page by <a href="https://github.com/wumss/seminar/edit/master/pages/document.md">editing it on GitHub</a>.</p></footer></section></body></html>
