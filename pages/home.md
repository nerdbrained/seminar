# UW Student Seminars

Welcome to the student-run University of Waterloo Mathematics Seminars. These
seminars run every Wednesday at 5:30 PM in (room to be determined) and provide
a platform for students to learn new topics and present them to others. This
Fall, the seminars will start in early October.

Each seminar consists of two 45 minute long talks. Topics include those in our
[list of suggested topics](/potential-topics/) and other topics of interest to
a general mathematical audience. Check out our [archive](/archive/) to look at
past topics and summaries of past talks. If you have any questions for us, you
can contact us by filling a form on our [FAQ page](/faq/) or alternatively
asking on our [Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/334849026859566/).

## Speak in Fall 2017

We are currently looking for speakers for Fall 2017. If you are interested in
speaking this term, please fill out our [talk proposal form](/submit-talk/). If
you don’t have a topic in mind, you can look at our [suggested
topics](/potential-topics/), or browse for topics by [tag](/tag/). Make sure
you read through the [important information for
speakers](/important-information/) before signing up to speak. We organize dry
runs before the scheduled date of the talks, especially for first time
speakers, to time the talk and to help build confidence. If you need help with
your talk, feel free to ask us for support — we try to help our speakers as
much as we can.
