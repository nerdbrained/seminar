# UW Student Seminars

This is the website for the student-run University of Waterloo mathematics
student seminars. We are a group of mathematics and computer science students
who are interested in learning new topics and presenting our new knowledge to
others.

We have yet to schedule talks for Spring 2017. Come back to the website nearer
to the start of the term to check out the schedule. See our [FAQ](/faq/) 
for frequently asked questions, and the [archive](/archive/) for talks 
before todayâ€™s date. To browse talks by topic, see the [tags](/tags/) page.

## Speak in Spring 2017

We are looking for speakers for Spring 2017. If you are interested in speaking
next term, please take a look at our [suggested
topics](/potential-topics/), or browse potential topics by [tag](/tags/). To
submit a talk proposal, fill out our [form](/submit-talk/). If you are planning
to speak in any term, we recommend you read the 
[important information for speakers](/important-information/) first. If you have 
any questions for us, we have a contact form on the [FAQ](/faq/) page.
