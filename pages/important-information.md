# Important Information for Speakers

## Preparation

- While you may feel free to change your topic at any time, we recommend leaving enough time
  to sufficiently prepare for your talk. Please notify us of any topic changes as soon as
  possible.

- Prepare your abstract at least one week in advance of your talk. **This is not a soft
  deadline.** If your abstract is not ready at least one week in advance of your talk, we
  may cancel your talk.

- If you feel that you will not be able to adequately prepare for your talk in time, do not
  hesitate to contact us. We will try to reschedule your talk.

## Notes

- If you decide to prepare notes for your talk, we would appreciate if you could send them
  to us to use for inclusion on the website.

- Notes must be translated into [Markdown](/write-markdown/), but we will accept notes in
  any format and will try our best to convert it to Markdown.

## Delivery

- Please come in time for your talk.

- If you are not confident about your talk, please [contact us](/faq/) and request that we
  hold a session to go over it.

- Please make the effort to attend as many talks as possible. The seminar is about both
  teaching and learning.

- Please read [Chris Godsilâ€™s
  comments](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cgodsil/Advice/talks.pdf) on how to deliver a
  good talk.
