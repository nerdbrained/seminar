Constructive mathematics is mathematics that avoids obscuring the underlying algorithms and
their computational information. A *constructive* proof is, or is readily turned into, an
algorithm to find the thing it’s claiming.

It is easier to understand constructivism by looking at what procedures in proofs are not
constructive. Here is a theorem in elementary calculus:

**Theorem**. There exist ``\{a, b\} ⊆ \mathbf{R}^+ - \mathbf{Q}^+`` such that ``a^b ∈
\mathbf{Q}^+``. (There are two irrational numbers ``a``, ``b`` with ``a^b`` rational.)

Here is a non-constructive proof:

**Proof**. Consider ``\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}``. If it is rational, we are done. Otherwise,
``\sqrt{2}^{\left(\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}\right)} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2`` is rational, and we are done.

This proof is classically valid. But imagine we needed these numbers ``a``, ``b`` for the
correctness of some algorithm. Which numbers would we use: ``a = b = \sqrt{2}`` or ``a =
\sqrt{2}`` and ``b = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}``? Here shows the difficulty of a non-constructive
proof: while it makes the claim that the requested numbers ``a`` and ``b`` exist, it does
not give any way to construct those numbers. Thus it is unsuitable for algorithmic purposes.

Here is a constructive proof.

**Proof**. Let ``a = \sqrt{2}`` and ``b = \frac{\log{9}}{\log{2}}``. Then
``a^b = 3`` which is rational, and we are done.

This proof is constructive because we can immediately use it in any algorithm requesting
such numbers ``a`` and ``b``, as they are constructed in the proof.

Let us try to turn the first proof into an algorithm, so we can better see what goes wrong.

```julia
# Compute `a, b` where `a` and `b` are irrationals such that `a^b` is rational.

if (√2) ^ (√2) ∈ 𝐐
    a = √2
    b = √2
else
    a = √2
    b = (√2) ^ (√2)
end
```

If we try to implement this algorithm, we see immediately what is wrong: implementing the
condition `(√2) ^ (√2) ∈ 𝐐` is hard. To have such an algorithm that can determine whether
`(√2) ^ (√2)` is rational, we would need to prove that it is rational, or that it is
irrational.

Note that in a non-constructive logic, the proof was valid because we could simply assume
that a correct decision can be made — though the proof does not tell us how to make it.
This is called the  Law of the Excluded Middle, an inference rule of non-constructive
mathematics:

```math
⊢ P ∨ ¬P
```

The Law of the Excluded Middle, from an algorithmic standpoint, is equivalent to total
omniscience. If for any proposition ``P`` we had an algorithm that determines the truth of
``P``, then using this law is valid constructively — as we would simply ask that algorithm
which branch to take.

Unfortunately, modern computers do not support omniscience, so the Law of the Excluded
Middle cannot be used in constructive proofs.

## Logic

There is not a single theory of constructivism; different mathematicians have developed
different approaches. Many modern mathematicians subscribe to a theory of constructivism
built on intuitionistic logic: in particular, the BHK interpretation.

The ideas behind the BHK interpretation are very simple:

- A proof of ``a ∧ b`` is a proof of ``a`` and a proof of ``b``
- A proof of ``a ∨ b`` is a proof of ``a`` or a proof of ``b``
- A proof of ``∀ x P(x)`` is an algorithm that given any ``x``, creates a proof of ``P(x)``
- A proof of ``∃ x P(x)`` is a **witness** ``x`` and a proof of ``P(x)``
- A proof of ``a ⇒ b`` is an algorithm that given a proof of ``a`` creates a proof of ``b``
- A proof of ``¬a`` is a **refutation** of ``a``

Here, a witness is a value that can be computed by an algorithm that demonstrates
constructively the existential proposition.

Note the two major differences from classical logic: in BHK, a proof of a disjunction is a
proof of one of the disjuncts. This makes more clear why the Law of the Excluded Middle must
be excluded from the BHK interpretation, as taking ``⊢ P ∨ ¬P`` as an axiom results in
something that purports to be a proof of ``P ∨ ¬P``, but is neither a proof of ``P``, nor is
it a proof of ``¬P``. Furthermore, a proof of an existential must explicitly give a witness.
Many classical proofs of existentials do not accomplish that.

We should clarify the meaning of the word **refutation** used above. A refutation of ``a``
is an algorithm that given a proof of ``a`` constructs a contradiction. There is special
syntax commonly used to denote contradictions: ``⊥``. Therefore, we can alternatively
interpret ``¬a`` as ``a ⇒ ⊥``.

## Limited Omniscience

Although we used the law of the excluded middle in our non-constructive proof above, that
does not mean that the statement cannot be proved in constructive mathematics. It merely
means that the particular proof we used involved total omniscience. (In fact, we did give a
constructive proof of this shortly after.)

Can every statement of classical mathematics be proven constructively, even if the currently
known proofs involve invoking some form of omniscience? Well, some statements are themselves
forms of omnisicence. (For example, it is hard to envision the law of the excluded middle
being provable constructively, as that would imply an algorithm to decide the truth of any
logical formula.)

We can measure the degree to which a statement ``P`` of classical mathematics is **not**
provable constructively by showing that ``P ⇒ Q`` constructively, where ``Q`` is some
principle that seems to require a certain degree of omniscience. In the most general case,
we might show that a statement ``P`` implies the full law of the excluded middle. However,
it is possible that ``P`` implies some other form of omniscience that is weaker than being
able to decide the truth of *anything*.

## Completeness of the Real Numbers

**(Theorem)**
If ``(a_n)_{n∈𝐍} ∈ 𝐑^𝐍`` is Cauchy, then there exists ``a∈𝐑`` such that ``\lim_{n→∞} a_n =
a``. (We call this the completeness of the real numbers. Intuitively, it means there are no
gaps.)
