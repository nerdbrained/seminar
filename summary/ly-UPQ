When I was doing abstract algebra, I was amazed by the similarities of the
Universal Property of Quotients in various algebraic structures. Let's start
with the Universal Property of Quotients in groups, rings, ``R``-modules, sets,
and topological spaces.

## UPQ in Grp/Ring/R-Mod/Set/Top

Let ``A`` be a group/ring/R-module/sets/topological space. Let ``E \subseteq A``
be a normal subgroup/ideal/submodule or in the case of sets or topological
spaces ``E \subseteq A^2`` equivalence relation. We have the following diagram:

![Commutative diagram for quotients of groups/rings/R-modules/sets/topological
spaces](/images/upq-groups.png)

Then for all homomorphisms ``f : A \to X``,  there is a unique homomorphism
``A/E \to X`` such that ``\overline{f} ∘ q = f`` if and only if ``E
\subseteq \operatorname{ker}(f)`` and in the case of sets and topological
spaces we have that ``x E y \implies f(x) = f(y)`` for ``x,y ∈ A``.

**Example**.
Note that ``\mathbf{Z}`` is an additive group/ring/``\mathbf{Z}``-module and
``2\mathbf{Z}`` is a normal subgroup/ideal/``\mathbf{Z}``-submodule Then there
is a map ``q : \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}`` given by ``n \to n +
2\mathbf{Z}``.

**Example**.
We have a map ``[0,1] \to S^{1} ≅ [0,1]/∼`` where ``x ∼ y`` if and
only if ``x = y`` or ``\{x,y\} ⊆ \{0,1\}``.

## Introduction to Categories

Here is a sketch of a definition of a category.

**Definition**.
A **category** is a collection of

  1. objects, denoted ``\operatorname{ob}(C)`` (note this need not be a set)

  2. homomorphisms for every ``A,B ∈ \operatorname{ob}(\mathcal{C})``, which we
     denote by ``f : A \to B``. We denote the collection of homomorphisms from
     ``A`` to ``B`` by ``\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)``.

  3. An associative way to compose for all ``f : A \to B``, ``g : B \to C``,
     ``h : C \to D``, ``(h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f)``.

**Examples**.
Set, Grp, Ring, R-Mod, Topological spaces (where homomorphisms are continuous
functions) and compositions are functions. All of these are examples are
concrete categories.

## UPQ in Categories

We use quotients to identify elements of an object in a category to get a
smaller object that is still in the category.

**Definition**.
Let ``\mathcal{C}`` be a concrete category (there is a forgetful functor from
``\mathcal{C}`` to ``\mathrm{Set}``).  Let ``A ∈
\operatorname{ob}(\mathcal{C})``. We can talk about ``P \subseteq
\mathcal{P}(A)`` (non-empty collection of subsets of ``P``) disjoint. A
**quotient** of ``A`` by ``P`` in ``\mathcal{C}`` is a *universal object* in
the category of ``\mathcal{D} \leq \mathcal{C}^{A}`` where

```math
\operatorname{ob}(\mathcal{D}) = \{ f : A \to X ∈ \mathcal{C}^A : \\
\text{ for all } S ∈ P, f(a) = f(b) \text{ for all } a,b ∈ S \subseteq A\}.
```

In other words, ``q : A \to \overline{A}`` is a quotient if and only if

  1. ``q : A \to \overline{A} ∈
     \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,\overline{A})``,
  2. for all ``f : A \to X`` such that there is a unique ``\overline{A} \to C``
     in ``\mathcal{C}`` such that the diagram commutes:

![Commutative diagram defining quotients](/images/upq-definition.png)

Although we say “a” quotient of ``A`` by ``P``, the quotient is a universal
object so it is unique! Thus we can actually say “the” quotient of ``A`` by
``P``.

## Existence of Quotients in Set, Grp

**Proposition**. (UPQ)
Let ``q : A \to \overline{A}`` be the quotient of ``A`` by ``P`` in
``\mathcal{C}``. Let ``f : A \to X`` be a map in ``\mathrm{Set}``. Then there
exists a unique ``\overline{f} : \overline{A} \to C`` such that the following
diagram commutes if and only if ``f`` satisfies condition (1) above.

![Commutative diagram related to above proposition](/images/upq-concrete.png)

**Proof**.
The reverse direction is clear by property (2). Let's check the forward
directions. Since ``\overline{f}, q ∈ \mathcal{C}`` then ``f = \overline{f}
∘ q ∈ \mathcal{C}``. Then for all ``S ∈ P`` we have ``a,b ∈ S`` then
``f(a) = \overline{f} ∘ q(a) = \overline{f} ∘ q(b) = f(b)``

**Example**.
There is a one-to-one correspondence of equivalence relations on ``X`` and the
collection of partitions on ``X`` (where ``X`` is a set), given by ``E \to
P_{E}``, the partition generated by ``E``.

**Proposition**. The quotients exist in ``\mathrm{Set}`` and ``\mathrm{Grp}``.

**Sketch of proof.** Let ``A ∈ \operatorname{ob}(\mathcal{C})``. Let ``P \subseteq
\mathcal{P}(A)`` be disjoint.

In the case of ``\mathrm{Set}`` we have

```math
\overline{A} = P \cup \{\{x\} : x ∈ A \setminus \cup P\}
```

which is a partition on ``A``. And the map ``q : A \to \overline{A}`` is given
by ``y = q(x)`` if and only if ``x ∈ y`` and ``x \to [x]``.

In the case of ``\mathrm{Grp}`` we have ``\overline{A} : A/N`` where ``N =
\{axa^{-1} : a ∈ A, x ∈ S\}`` is the normal closure of ``S``. Let

```math
S_C = \{xy^{-1} : x,y ∈ C\}
```

for ``C ∈ P``. Let ``S = \bigcup_{C ∈ P} S_C``. Let ``q : A \to A/N`` be the
normal quotient map.

**Remark**.
If ``N ⊴ A`` then the quotient is ``q : A \to A/N``.

## Non-Existence of Quotients in Field

Let's show that there is no nontrivial quotient in the category of fields.

**Proposition**.
Non-trivial quotients do not exist in ``\mathrm{Field}``. That is, for all
field ``A`` field, there is no quotient of ``A`` by ``P`` in ``\mathrm{Field}``
where ``P ≠ ∅`` or a set of singletons in ``A``.

**Proof**.
Assume toward a contradiction that there is ``q : A \to \overline{A}``, where
``A`` is a field. Then we have ``q`` one to one. But ``\mathrm{C} ∈ P`` such
that ``a ≠ b ∈ C`` such that ``q(a) = q(b)`` and this is our
contradiction.

## Applications

**Definition**.
Let ``M,N`` be ``R``-modules. A **tensor product** of ``M, N`` over ``R`` is an
R-bilinear map ``⊗: M × N → M ⊗_R N`` such that for all ``R``-bilinear maps ``M
\times N \to L``, there exists a unique ``M ⊗_R N \to L`` ``R``-module
homomorphism such that the following diagram commutes.

![Commutative diagram defining tensor products](/images/tensor-product-up.png)

A construction of tensor products is given by the following commutative
diagram:

![Commutative diagram depicting a particular construction of tensor
products](/images/tensor-product-construction.png)

where

```math
K = ⟨ (x_1, λy_1 + y_2) - λ(x_1, y_1) - (x_1, y_2), \\
      (λx_1 + x_2, y_1) - λ(x_1, y_1) - (x_2, y_1) : \\
      x_1 ∈ M, x_2 ∈ M, y_1 ∈ N, y_2 ∈ N, λ ∈ R ⟩
```

Let ``\mathcal{C}`` be the category of algebraic structures. Algebraic
structures are sets with one or more operations defined on it, which satisfy
certain axioms. Let ``q : A \to \overline{A}`` the quotient of ``A`` by ``P``
in ``\mathcal{C}`` and ``\overline{A} ≅ \{q^{-1}(a) : a ∈ A \}`` which is
the fibers of ``q`` and ``q : A \to A/N = \{q^{-1}(a)  : a ∈ A/N\} = aN``.

Note that if the quotient exists, it is always of the form ``q : A \to A/∼``
where ``∼`` is an equivalence relation.

**Proposition**. (First Isomorphism Theorem)
Let ``f : A \to B ∈ \mathcal{C}``. Then ``A/∼ ≅
\operatorname{Image}(f) ∈ \mathcal{C}``.

Let's finish with some remarks. In a general concrete category, when is a
quotient homomorphism onto? This may be an open problem.

Note the way to relate the quotient of an object A in any concrete category to
the quotient of the same ``A`` which is a set in the category of Set, which is
via the UPQ (the diagram) in the category of Set.
