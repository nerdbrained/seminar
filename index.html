We are a group of mathematics and computer science students who are interested in learning new topics and presenting our new knowledge to others.</p><p>We meet every Friday in MC 4045. See our <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for frequently asked questions, and the <a href="/archive">archive</a> for talks before todayâ€™s date. To browse talks by topic, see the <a href="/tags">tags</a> page. Here is a link to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/334849026859566/">facebook group</a>.</p><h2>Talks for Winter 2017</h2><p>Talks for Winter 2017 have been scheduled. If you are interested in speaker this term or in a future term, please take a look at our <a href="/potential-topics">suggested topics</a>, or browse potential topics by <a href="/tags">tag</a>. To submit a talk, fill out our <a href="/submit-talk">form</a>. If you are speaking this term or looking to speak in a future term, we recommend you read the <a href="/important-information">important information for speakers</a> first.</p></div><h2>Upcoming Talks</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Topic</th><th>Speaker</th><th>Location</th><th>Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Talks on Friday March 3, 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Total Functional Programming</td><td>Adam Hofmann</td><td>MC 4045</td><td>17:30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div><p>Total functional programming is a paradigm of functional programming with the additional restriction that all functions must be total; that is, every function is defined for every element of its domain.</p><p>The immediate benefits of total functional programming are clear; every function in a total language is guaranteed to terminate and not cause a runtime error. This talk will cover the basics of writing and understanding functions that are total, as well as benefits that come from having totality.</p><p>Also in the scope of this talk is the major trade offs of total functional programming, including Turing completeness and things like input and output that seem unattainable. This is accompanied by strategies to write functions with non-trivial proofs of termination such that totality is guaranteed and verifiable by the interpreter.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td>Bloom Filters and Other Probabilistic Data Structures</td><td>Luthfi Mawarid</td><td>MC 4045</td><td>18:30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div><p>With the advent of big data, the ability to process large volumes of data is becoming increasingly important. For instance, when dealing with large data sets, we may want to perform simple operations such as counting the number of unique elements or checking whether or not an element is present in the set. While there are deterministic data structures, such as hash tables, that can perform these quickly, the sheer size of the data involved makes their use largely  impractical and unscalable.Instead, we may want to trade-off some accuracy in our  answers in exchange for greater space efficiency and ease of parallelization.  For this, we introduce the concept of probabilistic data structures. </p><p>In this talk, we will mainly focus on Bloom filters, which are commonly used to test set membership and speed up data access. We will explore its main use cases, its implementation details, and the mathematics behind it. If time permits, I will also talk about the count min-sketch, used for frequency counting, and/or the HyperLogLog counter, used for cardinality estimation.</p><p>This talk will assume basic knowledge of probability.</p><h2>Outline</h2><ul><li><p>What are probabilistic data structures?
