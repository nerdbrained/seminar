He published his solution in the journal in May of the following year, and noted that the solution is the same curve as Huygens's tautochrone curve. After deriving the differential equation for the curve by the method given above, he went on to show that it does yield a cycloid. Bernoulli allowed six months for the solutions but none were received during this period. At the request of Leibniz, the time was publicly extended for a year and a half. On 29 January 1697 the challenge was received by Isaac Newton, who found it in his mail, in a letter from Johann Bernoulli, when he arrived home from the Royal Mint at 4 p.m., and stayed up all night to solve it and mailed the solution anonymously by the next post. Upon reading the solution, Bernoulli immediately recognized its author, exclaiming that he 'recognizes a lion from his claw marks'. This story gives some idea of Newton's power, since Johann Bernoulli took two weeks to solve it. At the end, five mathematicians responded with solutions: Newton, Jakob Bernoulli (Johann's brother), Gottfried Leibniz, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Guillaume de l'Hôpital. Four of the solutions (excluding l'Hôpital's) were published in the same edition of the journal as Johann Bernoulli's. In his paper Jakob Bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that above before showing that its solution is a cycloid.[8] According to Newtonian scholar Tom Whiteside, In an attempt to outdo his brother, Jakob Bernoulli created a harder version of the brachistochrone problem. In solving it, he developed new methods that were refined by Leonhard Euler into what the latter called (in 1766) the calculus of variations. </p></div><p>Possible reference materials for this topic include</p><ul><li><div><p><a href="http://www.osaka-ue.ac.jp/zemi/nishiyama/math2010/cycloid.pdf">Yutuka Nishiyama</a></p></div></li></ul><p>Past and scheduled talks on a related subject include</p><ul><li><span><a href="/archive/mj-BCV">Brachistochrone</a> by Manas Joshi</span></li></ul><p>Quick links: <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=The Brachistochrone and the Calculus of Variations">Google search</a>, <a href="http://search.arxiv.org:8081/?query=The Brachistochrone and the Calculus of Variations">arXiv.org search</a>, <a href="/submit-talk">propose to present a talk</a></p><p><a class="tag-link tag-applied-mathematics" href="/tag/applied-mathematics">applied mathematics</a> <a class="tag-link tag-calculus-of-variations" href="/tag/calculus-of-variations">calculus of variations</a> <a class="tag-link tag-physics" href="/tag/physics">physics</a> </p></article><footer><p>Help improve this page by <a href="https://github.com/wumss/seminar/edit/master/wiki/tag/Remarkable.Tags.Tag(&quot;calculus of variations&quot;).md">editing it on GitHub</a>.</p></footer></section></body></html>
